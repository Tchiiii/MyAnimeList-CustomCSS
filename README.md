# MyAnimeList-CustomCSS

1. Install the ValerioLyndon's theme: https://github.com/ValerioLyndon/MAL-Public-List-Designs

2. Next you can copy-paste the color theme(not made by me): https://github.com/Tchiiii/MyAnimeList-CustomCSS/blob/master/Coloured-Menu

3. You can finally add at the end the custom button:
 - If you want to change the status "Dropped" into "Airing Watching"
   you can paste the content of this:
   https://github.com/Tchiiii/MyAnimeList-CustomCSS/blob/master/dropped-to-airing.css

- If you want to change the status "On Hold" into "Airing Watching"
   you can paste the content of this:
   https://github.com/Tchiiii/MyAnimeList-CustomCSS/blob/master/onhold-to-airing.css
   
You can also change the text in the custom button, but you need to edit:
- In the "img/template.psd", change the pictures size(do not change the height, only the width), the text and save them into .png pictures
- Change the "width" in the .css script into the width size of the .png pictures

You can also need:
- Photoshop
- Oswald font (none & hover => Medium | on => Bold)
