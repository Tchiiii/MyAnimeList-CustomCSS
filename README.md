# MyAnimeList-CustomCSS

1. Install the ValerioLyndon's theme: https://github.com/ValerioLyndon/MAL-Public-List-Designs

2. Next you can copy-paste the color theme(not made by me): https://github.com/Tchiiii/MyAnimeList-CustomCSS/blob/master/Coloured-Menu

3. You can finally add at the end the custom button:
 - If you want to change the status "Dropped" into "Airing Watching"
   you can paste the content of this:
   https://github.com/Tchiiii/MyAnimeList-CustomCSS/blob/master/dropped-to-airing.css

- If you want to change the status "On Hold" into "Airing Watching"
   you can paste the content of this:
   https://github.com/Tchiiii/MyAnimeList-CustomCSS/blob/master/onhold-to-airing.css
   
You can also change the text in the custom button, but you need to edit the template.psd in the "img" folder and change the size of all pictures and the "width" on the .css
